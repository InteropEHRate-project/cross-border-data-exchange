<h3>Content explanation</h3>
<p>
This ValueSet contains a list of codes from which at least one must be part of the concept in the code attribute of the <a href="StructureDefinition-Medication-IEHR.html">Medication-IEHR</a> profile.
Each of the ValueSets that are a part of this set contains codes for a specific use case:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>in general a code from the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/STU1/ValueSet-whoatc-uv-ips.html">WHO ATC - IPS</a> ValueSet should be used</li>
<li>if the local code provided is not an ATC code and the semantic translator could not find a translation, it should instead add the nullflavor 'OTH' from the system <a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor">http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
While the validator will accept resources where the concept has codes from different use cases, this behaviour is not intended and can cause issues.
The use cases and ValueSet are designed to be unambiguous and as such it should not be possible to use codes from different use cases with the same meaning.
</p>
<p>
A valid concept should contain the original/local codes provided by the original author and must contain an additional code, with either the same or the closest possible meaning to the local code, from one of the use cases, if the original code is not from this ValueSet.
